    <p class="mb-4">Hi there! My name is Jan, and I love making things happen or solving problems using programming. There's just
      something about it that intrigued me when I was younger.</p>
    <p>I started dabbling on code when I was around 14 years old. At one point, I hacked a game I really liked. I
      eventually told the owner of the game about the vulnerability of their application. This led them to bring me
      into their team.
